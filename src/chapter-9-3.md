Practicing mindfulness daily is essential for continuing to grow in your mindfulness practice.

Cultivating self-compassion is an important aspect of maintaining a mindful approach to technology use. This may involve recognizing and accepting one's own limitations and being kind and compassionate toward oneself when struggling with technology use or other challenges.
